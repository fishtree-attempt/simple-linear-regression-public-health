Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain.
This lesson was designed for researchers interested in working with public health data in R, but may be of interest to researchers in other fields as well.

This lesson provides an introduction to simple linear regression. The episodes cover the concept of simple
linear regression, the use of simple linear regression with various types of predictor variables
(single continuous variable, single factor variable with two groups and single factor variable with more than two groups),
predictions of the mean and the assessment of model fit and assumptions.

## Getting started

To get started, see the instructions in the [Setup](setup.html) page.
There you will learn how to obtain the data and packages used in this lesson.

### **Prerequisites**

This lesson does not require a formal background in statistics.

This lesson requires:

- Working copies of R and RStudio. See [here](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) for installation instructions.
- An understanding of how to use the Tidyverse packages to summarise and manipulate data in RStudio.
  See these episodes on [data handling](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html) and
  [data manipulation](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html).
- An understanding of how to use the ggplot2 package to plot data in RStudio.
  See [this episode](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html) on data visualisation.
- An understanding of the concepts covered in the
  [Statistical thinking for public health](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/statistical-thinking-public-health/)
  lesson.
