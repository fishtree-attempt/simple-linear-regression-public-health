objectives:
  - "Use the ggplot2 package to explore the relationship between a continuous variable and a factor variable with more than two levels."
  - "Use the lm command to fit a simple linear regression with a factor explanatory variable with more than two levels."
  - "Use the jtools package to interpret the model output."
  - "Use the jtools and ggplot2 packages to visualise the resulting model."
keypoints:
- As a first exploration of the data, construct a violin plot to describe the relationship between the two variables.
- Use `lm()` to fit the simple linear regression model.
- Use `summ()` to obtain parameter estimates for the model.
- The intercept estimates the mean in the outcome variable for the baseline group. The other parameters estimate the differences in the means in the outcome variable between the baseline and contrast groups.
- Use `effect_plot()` to visualise the estimated means per group along with their 95% CIs.
questions:
- How can we explore the relationship between one continuous variable and one multi-level categorical variable prior to fitting a simple linear regression?
- How can we fit a simple linear regression model with one multi-level categorical explanatory variable in R?

In this episode we will study linear regression with one categorical variable with more than two levels. We can explore the relationship between two variables ahead of fitting a model using the `ggplot2` package.

## Exploring the relationship between a continuous variable and a multi-level categorical variable
Let us take `Work` and `Age` as an example. `Work` describes whether someone is looking for work, not working or working. In the code below, we first subset our data for working age individuals using `filter()` and `between()`. We then initiate a plotting object using `ggplot()`, with the data passed on to the plot command by the pipe. We select the variables of interest inside `aes()`. We then create a violin plot using `geom_violin`. The shapes of the objects are representative of the distributions of `Age` in the three groups. We overlay the means and their 95% confidence intervals using `stat_summary()`. Finally, we change the axis labels using `xlab()` and `ylab()` and the x-axis ticks using `scale_x_discrete()`. This latter step ensures that the `NotWorking` data is labelled as `Not Working`, i.e. with a space. 


~~~
dat %>%
  filter(between(Age, 16, 64)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Work, y = Age)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", size = 0.2) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2) + 
  xlab("Working status") + 
  ylab("Age (years)") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c('Looking','Not Working','Working'))

## Fitting and interpreting a simple linear regression model with one multi-level categorical variable
We proceed to fit a linear regression model using the `lm()` command, as we did in the previous episode. The model is then interpreted using `summ()`. The intercept in the `summ()` output is the estimated mean for the baseline, i.e. for participants that are looking for work. The `WorkNotWorking` estimate is the estimated average difference in `Age` between participants that are not working and are looking for work. Similarly, the `WorkWorking` is the estimated average difference in `Age` between participants that are working and are looking for work.


~~~
Age_Work_lm <- dat %>%
  filter(between(Age, 16, 64)) %>%
  lm(formula = Age ~ Work)

summ(Age_Work_lm, confint = TRUE, digits = 3)

The model can therefore be written as:

$$E(Age) = 34.208 + 4.398 \times x_1 + 5.620 \times x_2,$$

where $x_1 = 1$ if an individual is not working and $x_1 = 0$ otherwise.
Similarly, $x_2 = 1$ if an individual is working and $x_2 = 0$ otherwise.

## Visualising a simple linear regression model with one multi-level categorical variable
Finally, we visually inspect the parameter estimates provided by our model. Again we can use `effect_plot()` from the `jtools` package. We include `jitter = 0.3` and `point.alpha = 0.2` so that points are spread out and so that multiple overlayed points create a darker colour, respectively. The plot shows the mean age estimates for each level of `Work`, with their 95% confidence intervals. This allows us to see how different the means are predicted to be and within what range we can expect the true population means to fall.


~~~
effect_plot(Age_Work_lm, pred = Work,
            plot.points = TRUE, jitter = 0.3, point.alpha = 0.2) +
  xlab("Working status") + 
  ylab("Age (years)") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c('Looking','Not Working','Working'))
