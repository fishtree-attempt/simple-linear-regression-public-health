> ## Exercise  
> A colleague has started working with the NHANES data set. They approach 
> you for advice on the use of simple linear regression on this data. Which
> of the following questions could potentially be tackled with a simple 
> linear regression model?  
>   
> A) Does home ownership vary across gender in the NHANES data set?  
> B) Is there an association between BMI and pulse in the NHANES data set?  
> C) Do men on average have a higher pulse than women in the NHANES data set?

> ## Exercise  
> We are asked to study the effect of participant's age on their BMI. We are given the following equation of a simple linear regression to use:  
> $$y_i = {\beta}_0 + x_i\times{\beta}_1 + \epsilon$$  
> Match the following components of this simple linear regression model to their disciptions:  
> 1. $y_i$  
> 2. ${\beta}_0$  
> 3. $x_i$
> 4. ${\beta}_1$  
> 5. $\epsilon_i$  
>  
> A) One participant's observed value for the response.  
> B) The expected response when the explanatory variable equals 0.    
> C) The expected change in the response with a one-unit increase in the explanatory variable.  
> D) The difference between a participant's value for the response and the
> expected value from the model.  
> E) One participant's observed value for the explanatory variable.
