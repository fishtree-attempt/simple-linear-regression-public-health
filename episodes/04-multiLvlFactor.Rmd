title: "Linear regression with a multi-level factor explanatory variable"
objectives:
  - "Extend the simple linear regression model with a two-level factor explanatory variable to the case of more than two levels."
  - "Use the ggplot2 package to explore the relationship between a continuous variable and a factor variable with more than two levels."
  - "Use the lm command to fit a simple linear regression with a factor explanatory variable with more than two levels."
  - "Interpret the output given by R after fitting this model."
  - "Use the ggplot2 package to visualise the resulting model."
