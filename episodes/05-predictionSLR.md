One of the features of linear regression is prediction: a model presents predicted mean values for the outcome variable for any values of the explanatory variables. We have already seen this in the previous episodes through our `effect_plot()` outputs, which showed mean predicted responses as straight lines (episode 2) or individual points for levels of a categorical variable (episodes 3 & 4). Here, we will see how to obtain predicted values and the uncertainty surrounding them.

First, we can calculate a predicted value manually. From the `summ()` output associated with our `Weight_Height_lm` model from episode 2, we can write the model as $E(\text{Weight}_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Height}_i = -70.194 + 0.901 \times \text{Height}_i$. The output can be found again below. If we take a height of 165 cm, then our model predicts an average weight of $-70.194 + 0.901 \times 165 = 78.471$ kg.

Weight_Height_lm <- dat %>%
  filter(Age > 17) %>%
  lm(Weight ~ Height, data = .)

Using the `predict()` function brings two advantages. First, when calculating multiple predictions, we are saved the effort of inserting multiple values into our model manually and doing the calculations. Secondly, `predict()` returns 95% confidence intervals around the predictions, giving us a sense of the uncertainty around the predictions. 

To use `predict()`, we need to create a `data.frame` with the explanatory variable values for which we wish to have mean predictions from the model. We do this using the `data.frame()` function. Note that the column name must correspond to the name of the explanatory variable in the model, i.e. `Height`. In the code below, we create a `data.frame` with the values 150, 160, 170 and 180. We then provide `predict` with this `data.frame`, alongside the model from which we wish to have predictions and `interval = "confidence"` to obtain 95% confidence intervals. 

We see that the model predicts and average weight of 64.88 kg for an individual with a height of 150 cm, with a 95% confidence interval of [63.90, 65.87].
