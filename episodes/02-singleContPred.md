title: "Linear regression with one continuous explanatory variable"
source: Rmd
objectives:
- Use the ggplot2 package to explore the relationship between two continuous variables.
- Use the lm command to fit a simple linear regression with one continuous explanatory
  variable.
- Use the jtools package to interpret the model output.
- Use the ggplot2 package to visualise the resulting model.

> ## Exercise  
> You have been asked to model the relationship between Total Cholesterol
> and BMI in the NHANES data. In order to fit a simple linear regression 
> model, you first need to confirm that the relationship between these
> variables appears linear. Use the ggplot2 package to create a plot,
> ensuring that it includes the following elements:  
> 1. Total cholesterol (`TotChol`) on the y-axis and BMI (`BMI`) on the
> x-axis, from the NHANES data.  
> 2. This data shown as a scatterplot.  
> 3. The y-axis labelled as "Total Cholesterol" and the x-axis labelled
> as "BMI".  
{: .challenge}




> ## Exercise  
> Now that you have confirmed that the relationship between Total Cholesterol
> and BMI appears linear in the NHANES data, you can proceed to fitting
> a simple linear regression model.  
>   
> 1. Using the `lm()` command, fit a simple linear regression of Total
> Cholesterol (`TotChol`) as a function of BMI (`BMI`). Name this `lm` 
> object `TotChol_BMI_lm`.  
> 2. Using the `summary()` function, answer the following questions:
>   
> A) What level of Total Cholesterol does the model predict, on average,
> for an individual with a BMI of 0?  
> B) By how much is Total Cholesterol expected to increase, on average, for
> a one-unit increase in BMI?  
> C) Given these two values and the names of the response and explanatory
> variables, how can the general equation $E(y) = \beta_0 + {\beta}_1 
> \times x$ be adapted to represent your model?
