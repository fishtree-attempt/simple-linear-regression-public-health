One of the features of linear regression is prediction: a model presents predicted mean values for the outcome variable for any values of the explanatory variables. We have already seen this in the previous episodes through our `effect_plot()` outputs, which showed mean predicted responses as straight lines (episode 2) or individual points for levels of a categorical variable (episodes 3 & 4). Here, we will see how to obtain predicted values and the uncertainty surrounding them.

## Calculating predictions manually
First, we can calculate a predicted value manually. From the `summ()` output associated with our `Weight_Height_lm` model from episode 2, we can write the model as $E(\text{Weight}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Height} = -70.194 + 0.901 \times \text{Height}$. The output can be found again below. If we take a height of 165 cm, then our model predicts an average weight of $-70.194 + 0.901 \times 165 = 78.471$ kg. 


~~~
Weight_Height_lm <- dat %>%
  filter(Age > 17) %>%
  lm(formula = Weight ~ Height)

summ(Weight_Height_lm)

## Making predictions using `make_predictions()`
Using the `make_predictions()` function brings two advantages. First, when calculating multiple predictions, we are saved the effort of inserting multiple values into our model manually and doing the calculations. Secondly, `make_predictions()` returns 95% confidence intervals around the predictions, giving us a sense of the uncertainty around the predictions. 

To use `make_predictions()`, we need to create a `tibble` with the explanatory variable values for which we wish to have mean predictions from the model. We do this using the `tibble()` function. Note that the column name must correspond to the name of the explanatory variable in the model, i.e. `Height`. In the code below, we create a `tibble` with the values 150, 160, 170 and 180. We then provide `make_predictions()` with this `tibble`, alongside the model from which we wish to have predictions. By default, 95% confidence intervals are returned.

We see that the model predicts an average weight of 64.88 kg for an individual with a height of 150 cm, with a 95% confidence interval of [63.9kg, 65.9kg]. 


~~~
Heights <- tibble(Height = c(150, 160, 170, 180))

make_predictions(Weight_Height_lm, new_data = Heights)
